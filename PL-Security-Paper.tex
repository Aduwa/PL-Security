\section{Abstract}

Physical layer key generation techniques based on wireless channel fading are generally considered to be secure as long as any eavesdroppers are separated from the terminals by a distance greater than the channel correlation length.  This assertion depends on an assumption that the channel is ergodic, while many real-world channels are not ergodic.  Linear prediction has previously been employed to predict samples of the channel transfer function ahead in time.  In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the channel transfer function in space as well, over distances much larger than the correlation length.  %we will have to compute the correlation length from the observed channel covariance matrix.  
This leads us to conclude that a more pessimistic ``safe'' eavesdropper distance for wireless fading based key generation is needed.

\textbf{Key words:} -- wireless, channel, fading, key generation, physical layer, security

\section{Introduction}

It has been demonstrated \cite{anyPLkeygenpaper} that two parties' reciprocal observations of wireless channel fading can be used to generate symmetric encryption keys on the fly in a situation where two parties cannot pre-arrange keys. 
%possible applications
%references about the current state of this technique 
%security claims and their reasoning - implicit assumption of ergodicity by depending on the channel's correlation length
However, it has been shown that real-world wireless channels are typically not ergodic vs. time \cite{isukapalli}.  In this work, we show that the spatial average of such a channel's correlation function is not equal to the ensemble average, meaning that the channel is also not ergodic vs. space.  This indicates that security claims based on the correlation length are inappropriate.  To develop a more practical estimate of the minimum distance from a node to an eavesdropper, we apply channel prediction techniques \cite{any duel-hallen paper} to investigate the distance over which it is possible to predict the channel transfer function.

Section \ref{ergodicity} applies the method of \cite{isukapalli} to show that the spatial average of a channel's correlation function is not generally equal to the ensemble average, indicating that the channel is not spatially ergodic. Next, in Section \ref{prediction}, we apply long-range prediction techniques to a series of spatial samples in order to predict the channel transfer function over distances greater than the correlation length.  In Section \ref{simresults}, we apply this technique to a simple simulated channel to examine the dependence of prediction length on the properties of the channel and the eavesdropper array. %these are: number of scatterers; eavesdropper element spacing; and number of eavesdropper elements.


\section{Spatial Ergodicity}\label{ergodicity}
%discuss ergodicity and its significance for the security assumption here - why does this section exist
This section follows the derivation by Isukapalli et al. \cite{isukapalli}, applying the same techniques to the spatial rather than temporal variation of the channel.


%added Doppler spatial phase variation to the channel model!!  f = fc+fd because f=(1+v/c)fc.  but k = 2pi/lambda, lambda = c/f, k = 2pi fc(1+v/c)/c.  so it's ok to write k as kc+kd, where kd = 2pi fd/c.
Begin by assuming that the channel is represented by a sum-of-sinusoids model as shown in Equation \ref{chan}.  The parameters $\alpha_n$, $\omega_d\cos\theta_n$, $k_d\cos\theta_n$, and $\vec{r_n}$ describe the amplitude, Doppler frequency shift, Doppler wavenumber, and location of the $n$th scatterer, and $\vec{r}$ represents the observation point.
\begin{equation}\label{chan}
h(\vec{r},t)= \sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n e^{j \omega_d t \cos \theta_n} e^{-j(k+k_d\cos\theta_n)\left|\vec{r_n} - \vec{r}\right|}
\end{equation}
An observation of the channel impulse response at a new location, $\vec{r}+\vec{\Delta r}$, can be written
\begin{equation}
h(\vec{r}+\vec{\Delta r},t) = \sum_{m=1}^N \alpha_m e^{j \omega_d t \cos \theta_m} e^{-j(k+k_d\cos\theta_n)\left|\vec{r_m}-\vec{r}\right|}e^{-jk\left|\vec{\Delta r}\right| \cos \psi_m}
\end{equation}

The correlation function (based on the ensemble average) for two spatially separated but simultaneous observations is shown in Equation \ref{ensemblecorr}.
\begin{multline}\label{ensemblecorr}
R_e(\vec{\Delta r})= E\left[\sum_{n=m=1}^N |\alpha_n|^2 e^{-j(k+k_d\cos\theta_n)|\vec{\Delta r}|\cos \psi_n}\right] +\\ E\left[\sum_{n=1}^N\sum_{m\neq n} \alpha_n^* \alpha_m e^{j \omega_d (\cos \theta_m - \cos \theta_n)} e^{-j(k+k_d\cos\theta_n)\left(\left|\vec{r_m} - \vec{r}\right|-\left|\vec{r_n} - \vec{r}\right|\right)}e^{-jk\left|\vec{\Delta r}\right| \cos \psi_m}\right]
\end{multline}
The second term in Equation \ref{ensemblecorr} is eliminated by the integration of the exponential containing $\left|\vec{r_m} - \vec{r}\right|-\left|\vec{r_n} - \vec{r}\right|$.  To simplify further, we assume that $E[|\alpha|^2]=1/N$.  
%the math is broken here because of the addition of the Doppler wavenumber.  it means that we haven't eliminated the integral over \theta_n like we otherwise would have been able to do. Needs a small redo from this point.


%this section might need some graphs in it, demonstrating how the correlation function and the spatial sample covariance are different for different situations

\section{Spatial Long-Range Channel Prediction Method}\label{prediction}
%since the channel's spatial variation is not ergodic, it is well suited to long-range prediction techniques (cite duel-hallen). rather than using long-range prediction to predict the channel transfer function ahead temporally, we predict it spatially.
%describe the problem setup: channel, eavesdropper
%assumption: the angle from eavesdropper elements to scatterers stays the same over all the eavesdropper samples and predicted samples (all scatterers are in the far field of an array of length Nd+Qd)

We are doing things differently %(differently from what? we have to cite so people know what to compare to). 

We take the channel model that is usually a fuction of time and align it along a listening array and transform it into a function of space. (This needs to be explained as the mathematical equations are given. Describe the variables and whatnot)

\section{Spatial Long-Range Channel Prediction Simulated Results}\label{simresults}
%in this section we apply the method from the previous section to a simulated channel
%describe the channel simulation (very similar to problem setup from previous section)
%find average prediction length and how it varies for different values of $d$ (element spacing in E), $N$ (number of elements in E), and $S$ (number of scatterers)

In this section we will go on to describe how we set about creating a channel model and the methods we used. (LPC, ARYule, MATLAB code explanations and code may be used here.) This section should have graphs that show our channel model and explain the methodology clearly. We are using the sum of sinusoids method to assemble a wireless channel with $S$ scatterers, $N$ number of array elements (spatial samples) etc... In this section we also discuss how we went about our predictions and how far out we can reasonably predict. How many times were the tests run?

\section{Conclusion}
%we applied long-range prediction to estimate the channel transfer function at a location in space that is separated from the eavesdropper by more than a correlation length.  This indicates that the minimum safe distance for secure key generation based on wireless fading must be reexamined.

%future work: add Doppler dependence, do a scenario where the eavesdropper moves through space and see if we can do spatiotemporal channel prediction simultaneously, see about 2D eavesdropper arrays and other problem geometries (what if all the scatterers are in an arc of the space instead of evenly distributed? does it matter?), do a security analysis by estimating the error of the prediction(?), demonstrate spatial channel prediction experimentally, investigate the effect of mutual coupling between array elements on the quality of the eavesdropper's predictions
